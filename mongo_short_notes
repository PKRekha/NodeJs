-------------------------------------------------

1) if we want to know all the dbs which are in the system, then type 

show dbs

2)if we want to go to any particular db or say connect to that db, then 

use db_name
eg:  use admin

3) if we want to know what are all the collections(tables in the database), then 

show collections

4)  if we want to know what are all the documents (rows in the table(collection)), then  

db.collection_name.find()
eg: db.movies.find()

5)if we want to insert data into collection,then

db.movies.insert({"object_Id": 880898878786767767767,"name":"kanthi", "course":"angular"})

while inserting data into mongo db, object_id will be created as a primary_key and we also can create our own object_ids.

we can not create duplicate primary key documents.

6)  if we want select with any condition like

select * from employee where ename='rekha';

db.movies.find({"ename":"rekha"});

7)we can find all the recordss count using,

db.movies.count()

8)  if we want to update any docuement or record, then

first we can give , on what basisi we want to update the value, and second one is which value we want to udpate.

db.movies.update({name:"rekha"},{$set:{course:"node"}});

9) while updating if condition is matching, then it will update or it will add new record. To do this task we have mention
upsert, while updating.

db.movies.update({name:"rekha1"},{$set:{course:"js"}},{upsert:true});

it means while it is updating , if it finds the record with name "rekha1" then it will update or else it will add new record as we mentioned upsert as true.

10)  if we want to remove the records from the collection, then
db.movies({})

then it will remove all the records or documents from the collection (table).

if we want to remove a particular record or docuement, then 

db.movies.remove({name:"rekha"});
