Babel:
    generally we write the code in either es5 or es6(latest version es2015), as a trending thing everybody write the 
    code in latest es6 version.if our complete file is in ES6 version, then compiler will not able to
    understand ES6 version , and it needs to be converted to ES5 and then it has to be executed.
    for this purpose, to change or to transpile the code from one version to another version, we use babel.
    babel will change the ES6 file to ES5 file , then execute it.
    to work with babel, we need to install the below packages.

    1) @babel/core
    2)@babel/preset-env
    3)@babel/register
    4)@babel/polifill

    then we need to make a file called .babelrc
    
    and we have to create one js file, in to which we have to rewrite the ES6 code into ES5, then we have to start the application from
    this point, by mentioning in the package.json, if we specify in nodemon app.js, then we
    need to change that to "nodemon start.js"
