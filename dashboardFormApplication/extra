this application is complete crud operation using mongo db and with UI using ejs view engine.

and we used babel also by writing my code in es6.

packages imported:

express
mongodb
ejs
body-parser
@babel/core
@babel/register
@babel/preset-env

by creating form using bootstrap, and jquery datatable, we created a table, by using these two,
we communicated with the back end . i.e nodejs and mongo db.
